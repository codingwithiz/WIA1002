My name is Lee Ing Zhen(your name) with matrix number, 22055760. I am
majoring in Software Engineering. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited but also worry about taking this
subject. This is because DS is challenging to me.

I acquired B+ for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will keep putting effort and maintain my interest in DS. Wish me luck!!!


I performed pretty sucks in the class.
And of course, I'm not really satisfied with my performance.
So, I will keep on motivating myself and try to chase up with others in terms of Data Structure.
I hope I can get A in Data Structure.
I think I did well in doing the tutorial and labs for Data Structure.
But, I will still explore myself more in Data Structure and strive for excellence.
